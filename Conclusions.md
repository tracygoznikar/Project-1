Conclusions and Recommendations

1. Netflix may be the better choice for those who are not price sensitive: overall Netflix has approx 3.5 times the volume of shows when compared with Hulu (3560 vs 903)
2. Average ratings for overall shows of english language origin on Netflix (6.28) are higher than for Hulu (5.91) and the difference appears to be significant: p~(.03)
3. The difference in ratings also appeared to be meaningfully in favor of Netflix for those who have a preference for shows that reflect a ‘Family’ genre (Netflix 6.08, Hulu 5.7). For someone who is price sensitive the difference between Netflix and Hulu might not be enough to purchase the more expensive platform however Netflix did perform better in the following categories:
4. Family, with a p=.015. Drama and comedy were close behind although p >.05. These genres are also reflective of higher volume movies which could be meaningful for consumer choice.
5. In addition Netflix performed better and might appeal more to the 16+ age group (mean score 6.32 vs 5.41 for Hulu, p=.009)
6. Analysis by decade of release indicates Netflix is ahead of Hulu based on average ratings (6.19 vs 6.03) for the current decade (2010-2020) and the difference is likely to be meaningful (p=.00089)
7. Shows with shorter runtimes received higher ratings overall. This is consistent with highest rating genres in the documentary, news, biography and history genres. Netflix has much higher volume of content in short shows when compared with Hulu <1.5 hour categories. The average ratings for shows in categories under 1.5 hrs was higher for Netflix than Hulu, with p of 0.05 or less, thus making Netflix the potential better choice for variety in high quality content.
